We were given 18,779 images of galaxies and asked to use them to:

* Train a CNN to estimate five parameters commonly associated with galaxy images.
* Assess the CNN's performance on a sample of mock images.

Such a tool could be used to describe and then classify new galaxys as they are identified.


A final report for the project can be found as a jupyter notebook in the file "cs109b_final_project_F_group_30_submit.ipynb".    
Also included is a PowerPoint presentation of our results "Project Pres Cox".
